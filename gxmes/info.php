										NullG*mes is a website with some Flash G*mes available to play.
										There are currently <b><?= $gameCount ?></b> g*mes available.

										This website was made with the goal of letting people still play
										old Flash g*mes after Flash shut down.
								</p>

								&nbsp;

								<p>
										NullG*mes uses GitHub to host files and
										<a href="https://ruffle.rs">Ruffle</a>
										to run Flash content.

										Some g*mes are also regular HTML g*mes found online.
								</p>

								&nbsp;

								<p id="credit">
										This g*mes website was originally based on the
										<a href="https://github.com/selenite-cc/flasharchive">
												flasharchive repo
										</a>
										by selenite-cc.

										Nullboy000 added hundreds more g*mes and converted it into
										a proper website instead of standalone HTML files.
								</p>

								&nbsp;

								<p>
										Feel free to fork this project or use it as a base for your own archive.
										Just give proper credit to both selenite-cc and Nullboy000.
